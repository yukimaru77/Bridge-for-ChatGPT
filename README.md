**Bridge for ChatGPT** allows you to use ChatGPT in your native language while leveraging the superior reasoning capabilities of English prompts.

## 🚀 Overview
Did you know ChatGPT often provides smarter, more logical responses when questioned in English?
This extension bridges the language gap. It automatically translates your prompts into English before sending them, maximizing AI performance. When the English response arrives, you can translate it back to your preferred language with a single click.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Auto-Translate Prompts:** Type in your native language (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.); the extension automatically converts it to English before sending.
* **On-Demand Reply Translation:** A "Translate" button appears next to each ChatGPT response. Click it to read the answer in your native language.
* **Preserves Formatting:** Markdown, syntax highlighting for code, and KaTeX math formulas are preserved even after translation.
* **Toggle Switch:** Easily enable/disable the prompt translation feature directly from the chat interface.
* **Powered by Gemini:** Uses Google's Gemini API for high-quality, high-speed translation.
